# Crud Application for Node

This is an example crud app using node and the express framework. This app also uses 
sqlite for the backend and ejs for the views. Basically its a simple message posting
posting app. 

I'm also using bootstrap to give it a little bit a css flair. The main goal is functionality not visual fidelity.
